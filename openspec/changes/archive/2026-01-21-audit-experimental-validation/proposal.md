# Deep Experimental Validation with Literature Cross-Reference

## Summary
Deeply validate the experimental section of the master thesis by cross-referencing with original literature, auditing experimental setups, and validating tables/figures against established benchmarks.

## Rationale
To ensure the thesis meets the highest academic standards, the experimental results and claims must be rigorously verified against the original papers they reference. This audit prevents misrepresentation and ensures reproducibility.

## Approach
1.  **Literature Cross-Reference:** actively search and read cited papers to verify method descriptions and baseline configurations.
2.  **Deep Experimental Audit:** Validate the data pipeline, training procedures, and evaluation protocols.
3.  **Table & Figure Audit:** Check every artifact for correctness, completeness, and consistency.
4.  **Gap Analysis:** Identify missing critical experiments or visualizations.
5.  **Report Generation:** Produce a detailed validation report with prioritized action items.
