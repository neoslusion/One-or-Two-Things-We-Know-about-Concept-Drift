# Master Thesis Comprehensive Review

## Summary
Perform a comprehensive, critical review of the master thesis on concept drift detection. The review will cover research foundation, methodology, experimental setup, results, writing quality, and technical correctness.

## Rationale
The thesis needs to meet high academic standards before submission. A structured audit will identify gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement.

## Approach
1.  **Systematic Review:** Analyze the thesis chapter by chapter against the defined criteria.
2.  **Code Consistency Check:** Verify that the described algorithms match the codebase.
3.  **Output Generation:** Produce a detailed audit report (`report/thesis_review_audit.md`) with findings and actionable suggestions.
4.  **Critical Fixes:** Apply immediate fixes for critical issues (e.g., typos, broken references, obvious logical errors) found during the review.
