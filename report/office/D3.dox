A distinct line of research in concept drift detection, particularly focusing on unsupervised methods, is represented by D3 (Discriminative Drift Detector), proposed by Gözüaçık et al.. Unlike many traditional drift detectors that rely on labeled data or model performance (explicit methods), D3 is an unsupervised method that operates by monitoring changes directly in the feature space. The core idea involves maintaining a fixed-size sliding window of the latest data, conceptually divided into "old" and "new" subsets. A discriminative classifier, such as Logistic Regression, is then trained to determine if these "old" and "new" data sets are separable. The degree of separability is quantified using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. A high AUC score (near 1) indicates that the classifier can successfully distinguish between the old and new data, signaling a concept drift when it exceeds a predefined threshold (τ). Upon drift detection, the "old" data portion of the window is discarded and replaced by samples from the "new" portion, while if no drift is detected, a smaller segment of the oldest samples is removed as the window slides. This innovative approach marks the first method, to the authors' knowledge, that utilizes a discriminative classifier for unsupervised concept drift detection in a stream setting.

D3's contributions include introducing a simple yet effective method for unsupervised concept drift detection and empirically demonstrating its efficacy against widely used baselines. In experiments conducted on eight diverse datasets (both synthetic and real-world), D3 consistently outperformed traditional supervised concept drift detectors like ADWIN, DDM, and EDDM in terms of average prequential accuracy, achieving the highest average rank. This superiority is attributed to D3's ability to signal drift quicker by detecting changes in the data's marginal distribution (P(X)), rather than waiting for the concept to adversely affect the classifier's performance (P(y|X)), as explicit methods do. However, D3 does have limitations: it cannot detect "real concept drift" where only P(y|X) changes (and P(X) remains constant), and it may trigger unnecessary alarms (virtual drifts) when P(X) changes but P(y|X) does not. Despite these drawbacks, the empirical results confirm D3's strong performance, especially on real-world datasets where changes in P(X) are often indicative of relevant drifts. Future work includes exploring kernelized versions and non-linear classifiers to expand its detection capabilities and investigating auto-parameterization for improved adaptability.
