In the realm of concept drift detection, a significant challenge lies in precisely identifying changes in underlying data distributions and denoising the signals indicative of such shifts. One notable approach, "ShapeDD" by Hinder et al., introduces a shape-based method for concept drift detection and signal denoising, specifically focusing on abrupt drift events. This method analyzes the structural properties of drift-induced signals to derive a filter mechanism. The core idea is that the drift magnitude, a quantification scheme based on distance measures between consecutive time windows, exhibits a characteristic shape (hl) in the presence of an abrupt drift event. This shape, defined by Theorem 1, depends only on the window length and not on the specific distributions or norms, allowing the drift magnitude (σ) to be decomposed into a scalar part (drift strength) and a shape part. ShapeDD leverages this property by fitting this parametric shape (hl) to noisy raw estimates of the drift magnitude (σ̂). The methodology employs Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as the distance measure due to its desirable properties, and an efficient sequential function fitting algorithm is derived to estimate the exact time point of drift (t0) and its strength (s) without requiring iterative approximations. This algorithm achieves an O(l) complexity per update, where l is the window size. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeDD offers superior performance in drift detection, achieving a low false positive rate, very precise pinpointing of drift events, and significantly minimal delay compared to other methods like HDDM and MMD. Furthermore, it effectively denoises the drift signal, particularly for smaller window sizes, leading to less "wiggly" and more robust estimates.
