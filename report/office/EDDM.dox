The Early Drift Detection Method (EDDM) is a concept drift detection technique designed to address changes in data distribution over time, particularly emphasizing gradual shifts. It was developed to improve the detection of gradual concept drift while maintaining good performance with abrupt changes.
Key Aspects of EDDM's Operation:
Error Distance Monitoring: Unlike methods that only track the number of errors, EDDM's core idea is to monitor the distances between consecutive classification errors. A concept drift is considered more probable when these distances become smaller.
Statistical Tracking: The method calculates the average distance (p'i) between two recent classification errors and its standard deviation (s'i) at each time step. It stores the maximum observed value of p'i + 2 * s'i (denoted p'max + 2 * s'max), which represents the point where the current model best approximates the underlying data concepts.
• Threshold-Based Detection: EDDM employs two thresholds, α and β, to signal changes:
    ◦ Warning Level: A potential drift is indicated when the ratio (p'i + 2 * s'i) / (p'max + 2 * s'max) falls below α (e.g., 0.95). At this stage, examples are stored in anticipation of a confirmed drift. If the ratio later increases above α, the stored examples are discarded.
    ◦ Drift Level: A concept drift is detected when the ratio drops below β (e.g., 0.90). Upon detection, the current learning model is reset, and a new model is trained using the examples accumulated since the warning level was triggered. p'max and s'max values are also reset.
Initialization: EDDM only begins searching for concept drifts after a minimum of 30 classification errors have occurred, as this is necessary to reliably estimate the distribution of distances between errors. The parameter values for α and β are typically set experimentally, such as 0.95 and 0.90, respectively.
Noisy Data Handling: The method can also handle noisy datasets by detecting when the frequency of classification errors increases, which might occur if a base algorithm begins to overfit.
Observed Performance and Limitations:
Gradual Drift Sensitivity: EDDM was specifically developed to achieve an earlier detection in the presence of gradual changes, even very slow ones. Experiments on synthetic data like 'Sine1g' have shown that EDDM can react earlier and more frequently than other methods like DDM when slow concept drift is present.
Detection Delays and False Alarms: Despite its intentions, comparative experiments, such as those with the Naive Bayes classifier, have indicated that EDDM can yield longer detection delays compared to methods like HDDMW-test and FHDDMS, especially in abrupt drift scenarios. It has also shown higher false positive rates and sometimes the highest false negative rates, as it might not detect concept drifts within acceptable delay lengths. For instance, on the Electricity dataset, EDDM detected a higher number of drifts (195 for NB, 168 for HT) compared to CUSUM (21 for NB, 19 for HT) but often with longer delays. In real-world datasets, EDDM may lead to more frequent false alarms compared to other methods.
Accuracy: In general, EDDM's classification error rates can be higher compared to methods like FHDDMS or HDDMs in certain datasets. However, in some contexts like Electricity and Forest Covertype, it can achieve comparable or slightly lower accuracy to some other methods.
Memory and Runtime: EDDM generally requires less memory and runtime compared to some window-based approaches like ADWIN or SeqDrift2.
Comparison to DDM: EDDM aims to improve upon methods like DDM (Drift Detection Method) by considering distances between errors instead of just the error rate. While DDM tracks the online error rate, EDDM tracks the distance between errors.
