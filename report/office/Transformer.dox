Addressing related challenges in dynamic environments, particularly electricity forecasting, Lin et al. propose the Meta-ADPTF method in their paper, "Transformer - Concept Drift Detection Method for Electricity Forecasting". This work focuses on overcoming the limitations of traditional offline prediction and existing concept drift methods that struggle to simultaneously detect drift, identify its category (e.g., sudden, gradual, incremental), and capture long-term dependencies in data streams. Meta-ADPTF introduces a novel architecture that combines a Transformer-based prototypical network with an adaptive window mechanism. The Transformer, used as an embedding function within the prototypical network, is crucial for extracting complex features and modeling long-term dependencies in time series electricity data, a capability often lacking in prior methods like FCNs. Drift detection is framed as a classification problem, where the method learns prototype centers for different drift types (normal, sudden, gradual, incremental) during a pre-training phase, and then classifies incoming data streams based on their distance to these prototypes. A key innovation is the adaptive window mechanism, which automatically adjusts its size during the detection phase. The window's capacity increases (by 10 timestamps) if no drift is detected, and halves if drift is confirmed, optimizing the detection process based on the presence or absence of drift. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets (Electricity, USEP, Renewables) show that Meta-ADPTF significantly improves both accuracy and robustness compared to a wide range of baseline drift detection algorithms, including traditional methods (DDM, EDDM, ADWIN, HDDM, KSWIN, Page-Hinkley) and other meta-learning approaches like Meta-ADD. This demonstrates Meta-ADPTF's enhanced ability to adapt to dynamic changes in electricity data and maintain model performance over time.
