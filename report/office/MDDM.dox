Pesaranghader et al. introduce the McDiarmid Drift Detection Method (MDDM), a novel approach designed for the rapid and efficient detection of concept drifts in evolving data streams. The method fundamentally distinguishes itself by leveraging McDiarmid's inequality, a powerful concentration inequality, to rigorously detect significant changes in data distributions. MDDM operates by sliding a fixed-size window over the prediction results (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect). A key innovation is the application of weighting schemes to the elements within this window, assigning higher weights to more recent entries to emphasize their importance and promote faster detection. The algorithm continuously calculates the current weighted mean (µ_tw) of the window and compares it against the maximum weighted mean observed so far (µ_mw). A statistically significant difference between these two weighted means, bounded by McDiarmid's inequality, signals the occurrence of a concept drift.

MDDM offers several variants based on different weighting schemes: MDDM-A (Arithmetic) uses a linear increase in weights, while MDDM-G (Geometric) and MDDM-E (Euler) employ exponential weighting schemes. The choice of weighting scheme influences the trade-off between detection delay and false positive rate, with exponential schemes generally leading to faster detection but potentially higher false positives. Extensive experimental validation on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrates MDDM's superior performance. On synthetic datasets simulating abrupt drifts (SINE1, MIXED), MDDM variants achieved shorter detection delays and lower false negative rates compared to state-of-the-art methods like DDM, EDDM, ADWIN, and HDDM, while maintaining high classification accuracies. For gradual drifts (CIRCLES, LED), MDDM algorithms also showed the shortest detection delays. On real-world datasets (ELECTRICITY, FOREST COVERTYPE, POKER HAND), where true drift locations are unknown, MDDM consistently yielded high classification accuracies and showed an increased number of alarms with less conservative confidence levels, indicating its effective adaptation to temporal dependencies in the data. This strong performance across various drift patterns and data types underscores MDDM's robustness and adaptability.
