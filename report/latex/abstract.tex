Currently, concept drift is one of the major challenges that degrades the performance of machine learning systems, especially in continuously changing streaming data environments. Therefore, in this thesis, the student researches solutions for detecting changes in data distribution, focusing on unsupervised methods while applying algorithmic improvements (such as ShapeDD) to achieve higher accuracy in the detection process. Additionally, the thesis conducts a comprehensive experimental evaluation, comparing the performance of the proposed model with existing methods to point out strengths, weaknesses, and future development directions. The thesis also proposes the design and implementation of a real-time monitoring system (using Kafka) to apply the drift detection model to real-world data processing problems.

\textbf{Keywords:} concept drift, machine learning, adaptive systems, data stream mining, non-stationary environments, drift detection, adaptive strategies
