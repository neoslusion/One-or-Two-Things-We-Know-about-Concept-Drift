Concept drift is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, occurring when the distribution of underlying data changes over time, leading to model performance degradation. This thesis investigates drift detection methods, focusing primarily on the Shape Drift Detector (ShapeDD), with particular emphasis on its theoretical foundation, practical implementation, and effectiveness across various drift scenarios. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the ShapeDD algorithm, utilizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to detect changes in data flow distribution. The thesis includes a detailed analysis of the MMD's theoretical basis, ShapeDD's multi-stage detection process, and its performance characteristics across various drift scenarios.

Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation on 10 controlled synthetic datasets, this thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of the ShapeDD\_OW\_MMD method — integrating Optimally\_Weighted MMD — to achieve high computational performance while maintaining high detection accuracy. The thesis analyzes the impact of key parameters such as window size, kernel selection, and statistical significance threshold on detection performance. The thesis proposes integrating ShapeDD with the CDT\_MSW method to automatically classify five types of drift (sudden, gradual, incremental, recurrent, blip) and apply appropriate adaptive strategies for each type. Key contributions include: (1) a systematic benchmark of 8 drift detection methods across 10 datasets with 30 independent runs and statistical validation (Friedman test, Nemenyi post-hoc), (2) integration and evaluation of recent MMD improvements (OW-MMD, MMD-Agg) achieving 7$\times$ throughput improvement while maintaining detection accuracy, (3) proposal of SHAPED\_CDT, an unsupervised drift type classifier achieving 80\% category accuracy without requiring labels, and (4) design of a Kafka-based streaming architecture for real-time drift detection and model adaptation.
