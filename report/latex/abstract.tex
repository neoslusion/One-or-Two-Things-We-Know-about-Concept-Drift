Concept drift is a fundamental challenge in machine learning where the underlying data distribution changes over time, causing model performance to degrade. This thesis investigates the detection of concept drift using the Shape Drift Detector (ShapeDD) method, with a specific focus on its theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and effectiveness across different drift scenarios. We present a comprehensive study of the ShapeDD algorithm, which employs Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to detect distributional changes in data streams. Our research includes detailed analysis of the theoretical foundations of MMD, the multi-stage detection process of ShapeDD, and its performance characteristics across various drift patterns.

Through extensive experimental evaluation on 7 diverse datasets (including synthetic and real-world) with controlled drift characteristics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ShapeDD\_OW\_MMD method -- integrating Optimally-Weighted MMD for computational efficiency (7× speedup) while maintaining high detection accuracy. We analyze the impact of critical parameters such as window size, kernel selection, and statistical significance thresholds on detection performance. The research integrates ShapeDD with CDT\_MSW method to automatically classify five drift types (sudden, gradual, incremental, recurrent, blip) and apply appropriate adaptive strategies for each type. The main contributions of this work include: (1) a detailed theoretical analysis of the Shape Drift Detector and its mathematical foundations, (2) integration of OW-MMD for high-throughput real-time detection, (3) development of drift-type-specific adaptation strategies with model caching for recurrent patterns, and (4) development of an end-to-end Kafka-based system combining drift detection, drift type classification, and automatic model adaptation.
